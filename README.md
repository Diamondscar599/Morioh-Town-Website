# Morioh-Town-Website

1. I decided to make use of width:100%; height: auto; in CSS for various sections
of the site to ensure that the site would not only function well
on mobile devices, but that no matter how the screen is expanded, the
site will display in a usable and appealing way.

2. I made use of the Javascript function scrollIntoView() on the visit
page to allow easy access to certain sections that grab the user's attention.

3. I decided to use container-fluid from bootstrap which would allow the nav bar
to be dynamic/responsive regardless of device/screen size.

4. The general colour scheme was created by just pure experimentation of picking 
colours I thought could look nice. Eventually I was satisfied with the look I was aiming for.

5. I had a serious difficulty getting an image to overlay whilst
being dynamic when changing screen size, so I opted to not overlay
it at all. This was the picture of the town (not the map) on the homepage
index.html. It worked out just fine in the end result in my opinion.

6. Originally I was going to go for a layout having text on the right
and images on the left beside it. But I ended up going for a more vertical
layout as it presented difficulty when trying to format the site
for mobile devices.

7. There are 2 unused keyframe functions in the CSS which I never
ended up finding places to use them that worked well for my idea. But they are still
there if curious.

8. The website is based off of a TV show named 'JoJo's Bizarre Adventure'
which is why the colour scheme might feel odd, but it does fit the town in the context
of the show. My actual home town felt boring to do so I made this. While it is fictional
the map contains the town that 'Morioh' is based on in real life.
