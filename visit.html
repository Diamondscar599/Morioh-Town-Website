      The Stone of Anjuro. A famous landmark. 
      It was created when an unknown highschooler 
      pummeled both a rock and Anjuro Katagiri at the 
      same time and integrated them together somehow.
      Despite its scary and grim looking appearance, 
      it is surprisingly familiar with the townspeople 
      and has gained popularity as a meeting point 
      for lovers. People say they can hear the rock growl 
      "Agios" at times.
      <br></br>
      Directions:
      Take the bus in Morioh, go towards the direction of J≈çzenji road. Get off at the third stop and walk for one minute.

      A fisherman started the rumor when he saw a 
      young woman falling from the cliff. 
      It was assumed to be a girl who was trying to commit 
      suicide by jumping off the cliff but she miraculously 
      bounced back up. The local fishermen all pray for 
      good luck to this particular rock, calling it a 
      'sacred spot'. Many also believe that there is a 
      god of the sea at work. 
      If one asks any local fisherman where 'Boing-Boing Cape' 
      is, they'll gladly point it out.

      Ghost Girl's Alley is a hidden road in the town of 
      Morioh that is believed to be the purgatory 
      between life and death. Residents have claimed to have
      seen 'Reimi Sugimoto', a girl who was murdered years ago, down the street.
      The road is a part of the Town's mythology at this point,
      you cannot find it yourself, people who have seen it claim
      that it dissapears after you're done with it. All that is truly
      known about it is that the street 'loops' as you walk around it
      until you are 'allowed' to leave. But those who claimed to have
      spoken with Reimi Sugimoto, say that she pressured them to never
      look behind them as they travelled the loop... or something would
      happen. But it's still unconfirmable if the street exists or not, as this
      is the only available photo and it doesn't match up with the town layout.
      Perhaps you might find it if you decide to come?
